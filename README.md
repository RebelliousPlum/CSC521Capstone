# CSC521 Capstone - Stock Market Predictor
This project is for CSC521, a capstone proposal class. This project is an attempt to predict stock market price trends using a RNN-LSTM.
At it's current phase, we are at the testing phase looking at training loss and validation loss.

To do:
1.) Add a prediction graph to see overfitting/underfitting.
2.) Test different LSTM architectures to determine best fit.
