                <h5>Daniel Masarsky:</h5>
                <p>Personally Stocks have always seemed interesting to me, and I figured what better way to learn about stocks then to build an application that predicts them. 
                    Also, while in college I took a class known as CSC 475, a basic cloud computing course, I was tasked with creating a project involving AWS and I remember enjoying AWS and wanting to use the tools provided with AWS in my capstone in some capacity. 
                    As such my primary objective was to assist in the creation a Stock Market Predictor that is hosted on AWS for ease of access. 
                </p>
                    <p></p>
                <h5>Tommy Thongsythavong</h5>
                <p>Experience in applying machine learning techniques. Also, I could use this stock market predictor to make better predictions than my guessing and improve upon that. Broaden my experience in support roles involving AWS and frontend.
