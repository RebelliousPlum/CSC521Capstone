                <h5>Daniel Masarsky:</h5>
                <p>Personally Stocks have always seemed interesting to me, and I figured what better way to learn about stocks then to build an application that predicts them. 
                    Also, while in college I took a class known as CSC 475, a basic cloud computing course, I was tasked with creating a project involving AWS and I remember enjoying AWS and wanting to use the tools provided with AWS in my capstone in some capacity. 
                    As such my primary objective was to assist in the creation a Stock Market Predictor that is hosted on AWS for ease of access. 
                </p>

                <h5>Tommy Thongsythavong</h5>
                <p>I am a recent graduate of Computer Science from Salem State, the goal of this project was to create a website showing Stock Market predictions via Machine Learning.
                    I have an interest in anything Data, AI, and Machine Learning related, so why not try to predict some stocks to make free money?
